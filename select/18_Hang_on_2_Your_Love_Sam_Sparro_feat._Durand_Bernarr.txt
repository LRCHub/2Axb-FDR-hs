Don't stop it...

Well it might sound a little crazy, but we are, made up of tiny little atoms far apart
And you can take that life to wherever you want, you're in a big flash ship
Made the dust to the stars and you might get a little crazy but some are crazier, yes some are crazier a-a-a-a-a

Don't stop it...

Infinite infinite infinite infinite...

Caught up in pumpin' circumstances
You forgot
That this was just a visitation
You are not
If for a long long time so be ready to die
Because you will someday and your momma will cry and if you think you're going crazy you probably are will you probably are

Don't stop it...

Infinite infinite infinite infinite...

Don't stop it...

Infinite infinite infinite infinite.
